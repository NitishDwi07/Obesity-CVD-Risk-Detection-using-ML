This is my first research paper work on detection of Obesity or CVD risk at an early stage usinf Machine Learning Techinques.
In this project 9 ML Algorithms were applied  were SVM model outperformed all other models with the best accuracy score of 97% followed by Ada Boost 96.59%.
This Research works can gives the best work so far which can we utilised to predict Obesity and other fatal diseases at an early stage, helping the patient get treatments before hand.
Thank you for reading and your support! I hope you have enjoyed this humble work!
